## Currently studying:
- Deep learning and reinforcement learning
- Internet of Things (IoT) application development

## ðŸ“š Competition experience and learning

### 1. **AMD AI Developer Competition**
**Period**: November 2023 - July 2024
**Achievements**: Although he did not win an award, he deeply explored generative AI and AMD platform technology in the competition and improved his practical application development capabilities.

### 2. **National Creative Modification Competition**
**Period**: November 2024 - Present
**Results**: Selected in the preliminary round, the theme of the work is "Seascape Style Modification Design", continuing to deepen creative modification and design capabilities, and demonstrating cross-field creative practice capabilities.

### 3. **Google Cloud AI Training Program**
**Period**: 2023-2024
**Content**: Participated in multiple AI-related workshops and practical courses, improving professional capabilities in AI application development and cloud technology.


## ðŸ§  My learning journey

- **Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning**: Currently learning how to use TensorFlow and PyTorch to develop neural networks, and studying the application of reinforcement learning.
- **Internet of Things Development**: Learning how to connect hardware devices to cloud platforms and develop smart devices and monitoring systems.
- **Self-made and Maker Projects**: I am keen on making things myself. I recently completed a self-made low-frequency massager and laser engraving machine, and uploaded the codes of these projects to GitHub.

## ðŸ”§ Open source contribution

- I have participated in multiple open source projects, especially in the fields of hardware and embedded development, and actively communicate with the developer community.
